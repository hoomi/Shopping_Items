# Shopping Items

It is a PoC Which extracts the data from a given Sainsbury's search page.

# Note

The data at the moment is hardcode in the jar file as html page is generated from javascript which makes it really hard to parse.
I either need a json/xml apis to do it or implement my own javascript engine
